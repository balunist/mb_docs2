Laser Kerf
==========

.. role:: blue

Laser Kerf will adjust one half of the laser kerf value outside each component perimeter
and one half of the laser kerf inside inner cutouts. The name implies utility for laser
manufacturing, but it could also be used when working with a CNC to account for a
router bit diameter.

The value of this setting is a floating-point number in the current default units. This
option is available when the **Map Output Type** is set to **DXF File** on the Options 
tab.

Shown here are the additional options for the **DXF file** export, including :blue:`Laser Kerf`.
